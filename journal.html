	so last class we learned about  how a website can be stored on a computer and in the cloud and you have to do some fancy stuff on terminal to put the computer website in the cloud. when i add code to the terminal it should update the website.
<br><br>
this is how you do it:<br>
cd ./desktop/c26om.github.io <br>
git add .<br>
git commit -m "add a message"<br>
git push<br>

today I had a lab with molly and we started working on a project with boxes and i learned how to make an image change when you hover over it. i'm really happy i took this class this year and i think i'll learn how to make a lot of cool things

today we did a little javascript coding which gave me cs0 flashbacks. but we also learned how to use the console to detect and collect data for what keys are pressed, where the mouse moves to, and how many clicks someone clicks. these things are called event listeners. and when i used to change elements of a website that's called the console - i just learned that.

today i had another lab and we worked on a javascript event listener to move a blue box. this was cool because i learned how to use coordinates and event listeners. the javascript is a little confusing but i'll keep working and hopefully it'll start making more sense.

<br>
today we made functions in java and we learned what a function does. it can basically make repeating images or do something a bunch of times so you don't have to make a hundred divs and it can just repeat an image with one piece of code instead of 500.

today I almost finished my gratitude project. i added a button and got the picture changing to work on space bar press. theres a weird issue when you press the space bar a heart div shows up in the corner but i'm working to find out why that happens and fix that.

i was playing around with chatgpt that molly told us to use and now event listeners are conceptually starting to make sense. i know that it's 'listening' for a certain event in the document (wherever you put it) 
<br><br>

recently we resolved an issue where in a certain position there would be a random heart that spawned in the top left corner by making the click count -1 when the button was pressed, because it used to register as a click and put a heart in the corner. 
<br><br>
1.9.24
<br>
today we worked on adding random variables to a page and then assigning names to the numbers so that a name will randomly be generated when the page is loaded. you use a random number then multiply it by 5 and round to the nearest integer, and each thing in the list is assigned to a number that will be output randomly.
