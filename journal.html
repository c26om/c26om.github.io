<p>so last class we learned about  how a website can be stored on a computer and in the cloud and you have to do some fancy stuff on terminal to put the computer website in the cloud. when i add code to the terminal it should update the website.

this is how you do it:
cd ./desktop/c26om.github.io
git add .
git commit -m then in quotes: i added this message
git push
