	so last class we learned about  how a website can be stored on a computer and in the cloud and you have to do some fancy stuff on terminal to put the computer website in the cloud. when i add code to the terminal it should update the website.
<br><br>
this is how you do it:<br>
cd ./desktop/c26om.github.io <br>
git add .<br>
git commit -m "add a message"<br>
git push<br>

today I had a lab with molly and we started working on a project with boxes and i learned how to make an image change when you hover over it. i had a little existential crisis but molly and i talked about it and we are all good. i'm really happy i took this class this year and i think i'll learn how to make a lot of cool things and hopefully use this to apply for internships or something
